STEPS I HAD TO TAKE TO GET AN APP INSTALLED ON THE IPHONE

1) Generate a CSR from Keychain: 
  * KeyChain Access -> Certificate Assistant -> Request a Certificate from a Certificate Authority
  * Fill in your Apple account's email address
  * For 'Common Name' use your apple account identifier
    * for me it was SmartLogic Solutions
    * On the Program Portal, navigate to Team -> Contact Info and use the value in the Name field
  * Check 'Saved to disk'
2) Submit your CSR
  * Program Portal -> Certificates -> Development -> "Submit CSR"
3) Approve the CSR
  * Program Portal -> Certificates -> Development
4) Download the WWDR Intermediate Certificate
  * Program Portal -> Certificates -> Development
  * in the grey box underneath "Your Certificate" table
5) Download the Certificate
  * Program Portal -> Certificates -> Development -> Download
  * in the table underneath "Your Certificate"
6) Add the cert to the 'login' keychain
  * Doubleclick cert after downloading, load it into the 'login' chain.
  * Verify that the cert shows up under the private key when viewing Keys in Keychain
7) Create an App ID for the new app
  * Program Portal -> App IDs -> Create New App Id
8) Create a Provisioning Profile
  * Links the certificate, the account, and a single device (seems like you need one for each testing device)
  * Program Portal -> Provisioning -> New Profile
9) Download the Provisioning Profile
  * Program Portal -> Provisioning -> Download (from the table)
10) Add Provisioning Profile to your Application Build
  * Plug in your iPhone
  * Open up Xcode's Organizer (Window -> Organizer)
  * Drag the provisioning profile you downloaded onto the device in the Organizer
11) Build and run the project in the Xcode
  * apple-R
  * should install it directly onto your iPhone.
  
  
**** I think that steps 1-6 can be omitted for any future apps.
